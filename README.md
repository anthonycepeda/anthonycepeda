### Hey! I'm [@anthonycepedaa](https://twitter.com/anthonycepedaa) (Anthony Cepeda) 👋

I'm a software developer from the Dominican Republic. 🇩🇴

I currently live in Madrid, Spain. 🇪🇸

I have been building APIs, tools and Microservices for process automation. 🐍

As a Software Developer, I really enjoy being part of the whole process: from planning, analysis and design, through implementation, testing and integration, to shipping a beautiful and handy solution to users, as well as maintaining it. 🚀

I am confident in my ability to be a team player, and I am always willing to help my colleagues. But, above all, I am a creative and solution-oriented person who always thinks big!

Lately, I help to develop and maintain a private cloud platform ✨

You can find me on: ❤️
