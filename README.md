### Hey! I'm [@anthonycepedaa](https://twitter.com/anthonycepedaa) (Anthony Cepeda) 👋

I'm a software developer from Dominican Republic. 🇩🇴

I currently live in Madrid, Spain. 🇪🇸

I have been building APIs, tools and Microservices for process automation. 🐍 

As a Software Developer, I really enjoy being part of the whole process: from planning, analysis and design, through implementation, testing and integration, to shipping a beautiful and handy solution to users, as well as maintaining it. 🚀

I am confident in my ability to be a team player and I am always willing to help my colleagues. But, above all, I am a creative and solution-oriented person who always thinks big!

Currently, I help to develop and mantain a private cloud plataform ✨
